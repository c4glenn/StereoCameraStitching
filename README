This repo is split into different parts

V#.py are the various versions of this test
V0 is using the built in Functions to generate point clouds (has some artifacts in the overlap region)
V1 is using OpenCV and stereo matching (its passive stereo and very noisy)
V2 is using Calibrated matricies in various forms to modify V0 to get better point clouds


resetCameras.py is a tool that will hardware reset all attached cameras, sometimes the cameras will stop outputting frames, but running this fixes it (it has been built into V2 so you shouldnt need to run it for that one)


Calibration/ contains scripts and images used to calibrate the cameras

numpySaves/ contains still pointclouds saved from the versions and a way to render them

SavedFrames/ has frames for use when you dont have physical cameras

TestsAndLearning/ has some various scripts that illustrate various concepts with the libraries and is a good way to understand how something works in MVP
